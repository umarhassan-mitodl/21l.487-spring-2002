Description
-----------

This course considers some of the substantial early twentieth-century poetic voices in America. Authors vary, but may include Moore, Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Pound.

Grades
------

I try to be decent. If forced to give a formula, I'd say something like: slightly over 1/3 for written work, slightly over 1/3 for other work, and leeway for my sense of whether you've learned something and helped others to learn.
